# Indecisive

Welcome to Indecisive!

A simple web app to help guide you through making decisions in life.

Don't know which clubs to prioritise this semester?
Don't know which university to choose from?
Don't know what work to do and when?

Worry not! Indecisive is here!

Indecisive breaks down decision-making into evaluating criteria. Indecisive allows you to create your own criteria to evaluate, and lets you evaluate your different options or activities through it. It then ranks your options into a priority list, with the ones that best fit your criteria at the top. It's that simple!

For example, are you having trouble deciding which university to choose from? Simply break it down into criteria such as "Proximity to NYC" or "Social life" and you'll be on your way to decision-making clarity!
